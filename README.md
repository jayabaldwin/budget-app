## Description
We wanted to create a budgeting software, that is simple but smart. It was imperative that all your essential data was laid out right in front of you and presented in a fun and interactive way. The goal of this project was to assist others in gaining control over their finances and make budgeting an enjoyable process… something you actually look forward to. 

### Application Features:
- Easily record daily expenses and categorise them for better organisation
- Users can create personalised budgets for various expense categories, such as groceries, utilities, entertainment, and more.
- Users can set spending limits and in the future we’d like for them to receive notifications when approaching or exceeding the budget.
- As well as expenses, users can input their sources of income and savings, this will be reflected on your panels that update as you input transactions.
- The application maintains transaction history, currently it is very basic but it will be developed into a comprehensive transaction history, allowing users to not only view past transactions but to search and filter by categories and date, and be inclusive of pagination for a more cohesive presentation.
- A cash flow graph comparing total income, expenses and savings for the months (this did not fit into our MVP but will be revisited at a later date)
